            Our Chefs tips for cooking the steak: Always have the meat at room temperature. 
            That way it'll be more tender. So if you can, take it out of the fridge for 
            30 minutes before cooking it. Enjoy!

            <li><p>Put the kettle on & let the beef rest</li>
                <ul>Boil the kettle. You'll need some boiling water to make the stock later on. 
                Ensure the steak is out of your fridge as soon as you think of it.</ul></p>
            <li><p>Prepare the Ingredients 
              <ul>Strip the rosemary leaves off the sprigs. Peel and finely slice the garlic. 
                Slice the mushrooms. Peel and slice the shallot. Set all the ingredients aside.</ul></p></li>
            <li><p>Cook the vegetables 
              <ul>Place some olive oil in a pot on a low heat. Add the shallot, garlic, 
                rosemary and mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes.</ul></p></li>
            <li><p>Put the kettle on again
              <ul>Dissolve the stock cube in approximately 100 ml of water per person.</ul></p></li>
            <li><p>Add the cannellini beans 
              <ul>Drain and wash the cannellini beans and add them to the pot with the garlic and shallot. 
                Now add the stock to the pot. Simmer the beans in the stock for 10 minutes. 
                While this is happening move on to the next step.</ul></p></li>
            <li><p>Cook the steak
              <ul>Season the ribeye beef with salt and pepper. In a large pan with a little olive oil, 
                fry the ribeye for about 3 minutes on each side turning occasionally. 
                When the steak is finished, remove to a plate and cover with tin foil.</ul></p></li>
            <li><p>Finish the dish
              <ul>When the steak has rested for a few minutes and the beans have cooked. 
                Serve the steak on top of the beans and mushrooms and pour over any resting 
                juices from the beef. Enjoy!</ul></p></li>
